/*
In Protocol Buffers, field numbers are used to identify each field in a message. This is necessary because the field
names are not stored in the serialized data, only the field numbers. This approach has several benefits:
  **Efficient serialization**: By using numbers instead of names, the serialized data is smaller and more efficient to transmit.
  **Backward compatibility**: If you change the name of a field, the serialized data remains compatible, as long as the field number remains the same.
  **Forward compatibility**: If you add a new field to a message, older code can still deserialize the data, ignoring the new field.
In summary, field numbers are used to enable efficient, backward-compatible, and forward-compatible serialization of data in Protocol Buffers.
